# Real-time Speaker Recognition
This repository contains algorithms for real-time speaker recognition applications. It is implemented using either _Gaussian Mixture Model_ or _Convolutional Neural Network_. For the _GMM_ part, a dynamic threshold can be used to improve the recognition efficiency, but sharply improves the training time.
